# Knowledge and Data: Final Project
 The final project is a cocktail-recommender using Knowledge graphs as a database and Angular for the frontend.
 The data was aquired from kaggle and turned into a knowledge graph (TTL files).
 
 To run the project:
 - Download GraphDB and upload the TTL files and start the server (Or you can use any knowledge graph platform e.x. StarDog) 
 - Change the SparQL endpoint in the JavaScript file to the correct one.
