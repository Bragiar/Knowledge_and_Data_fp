Scurvy was a common disease of the ordinary seamen of the navy due to a lack of vitamin C while on long voyages without fresh supplies of fruit and vegetables.

Traditionally, a mojito is a cocktail that consists of five ingredients: white rum, sugar (traditionally sugar cane juice), lime juice, soda water, and mint. The original Cuban recipe uses spearmint or yerba buena, a mint variety very popular on the island. Its combination of sweetness, refreshing citrus, and mint flavors is intended to complement the potent kick of the rum, and has made this clear highball a popular summer drink. The cocktail has a relatively low alcohol content (about 10 percent alcohol by volume). When preparing a mojito, lime juice is added to sugar (or syrup) and mint leaves. The mixture is then gently mashed with a muddler. The mint leaves should only be bruised to release the essential oils and should not be shredded. Then rum is added and the mixture is briefly stirred to dissolve the sugar and to lift the mint leaves up from the bottom for better presentation. Finally, the drink is topped with crushed ice and sparkling soda water. Mint leaves and lime wedges are used to garnish the glass. The mojito is one of the most famous rum-based highballs. There are several versions of the mojito."@en ;

Squeeze the juice of one lime into it. 1 small lump of ice. 1 wine glass of Plymouth gin. Fill the glass with syphon seltzer, and serve with small bar spoon.Since 2008 the rickey has enjoyed a resurgence with the revival of classic cocktails and a group of Washington, D.C.\u2013based bartenders, known as the DC Craft Bartenders Guild, establishing July as Rickey Month. It was also featured with bourbon by political commentator and amateur mixologist Rachel Maddow on the Martha Stewart show for election night, 2008.

It was the creation of J. Marion Legendre and Reginald Parker of New Orleans, who learned how to make absinthe while in France during World War I. It first went on sale following the repeal of Prohibition, and was unique in its category as an absinthe substitute, as opposed to a pastis. Herbsaint was originally produced under the name \"Legendre Absinthe\", although it never contained Grande Wormwood (Artemisia absinthium). The Federal Alcohol Control Administration soon objected to Legendre's use of the word \"absinthe\", so the name was changed to \"Legendre Herbsaint\". The Sazerac Company bought J.M. Legendre & Co. in June 1949. Herbsaint was bottled at 120 proof and 100 proof for many years, but the recipe was modified in the mid-1950s, when Herbsaint began being bottled at 100 proof and 90 proof. By the early 1970s the 100 proof variation was discontinued, and the 90 proof version remains the predominant Herbsaint available today. In December 2009, the Sazerac Company reintroduced J.M. Legendre's original 100 proof recipe as Herbsaint Original.

It is usually a multi-user drink, served to a group in a special, ritual vessel known as a volcano bowl, which is a decorative ceramic bowl (typically of about 32 US fluid ounces (950 ml) capacity) designed with a rising central hub feature usually resembling a crude volcano cone. The cone includes a second, much smaller central pit or \"crater\" which is partially filled with rum or other flammable high-alcohol liquor. The \"crater\" liquor is then ignited, creating a mild volcanic ambience with its central blue flame. This central flame can be interpreted as symbolically suggesting spiritual or emotional unity among those partaking of the community beverage. The flaming volcano is usually served to a group of two or more friends with a set of very long colored straws to create a festive atmosphere, to facilitate convenient sipping from a comfortable distance, to prevent regrettable head impacts, and for fire safety, as unintentional hair ignition could result if users bent too near the central flame while imbibing."@en ;

	dbp:name	"Pisco sour" ;
	dbo:abstract	"A pisco sour is a cocktail typical of the cuisines from Peru and Chile, considered also a South American classic. The drink's name comes from pisco, which is its base liquor, and the cocktail term sour, in reference to sour citrus juice and sweetener components. The Peruvian pisco sour uses Peruvian pisco as the base liquor and adds Key lime (or lemon) juice, syrup, ice, egg white, and Angostura bitters. The Chilean version is similar, but uses Chilean pisco and pica lime, and excludes the bitters and egg white. Other variants of the cocktail include those created with fruits like pineapple or plants such as coca leaves. The cocktail originated in Lima, Peru, and was invented by Victor Vaughen Morris, an American bartender, in the early 1920s. Morris left the United States in 1903 to work in Cerro de Pasco, a city in central Peru. In 1916, he opened Morris' Bar in Lima, and his saloon quickly became a popular spot for the Peruvian upper class and English-speaking foreigners. The pisco sour underwent several changes until Mario Bruiget, a Peruvian bartender working at Morris' Bar, created the modern Peruvian recipe of the cocktail in the latter part of the 1920s by adding Angostura bitters and egg whites to the mix. In Chile, folklorist Oreste Plath attributed the invention of the drink to Elliot Stubb, an English steward of a ship named Sunshine, who allegedly mixed Key lime juice, syrup, and ice cubes to create the cocktail in a bar, in 1872, in the port city of Iquique, which at that time was part of Peru. Regardless, the original source cited by Plath attributed to Stubb the invention of the whiskey sour\u2014not the pisco sour. The oldest known mentions of the pisco sour are from a 1921 magazine attributing Morris as the inventor and a 1924 advertisement for Morris' Bar published in a newspaper from the port of Valpara\u00EDso, Chile. Chile and Peru both claim the pisco sour as their national drink, and each asserts ownership of the cocktail's base liquor\u2014pisco; consequently, the pisco sour has become a significant and oft-debated topic of Latin American popular culture. The two kinds of pisco and the two variations in the style of preparing the pisco sour are distinct in both production and taste. Peru celebrates a yearly public holiday in honor of the cocktail during the first Saturday of February."@en ;

Modern bumbo is often made with dark rum, citrus juice, Grenadine, and nutmeg. A related drink is the Traitor, made with orange juice, rum, honey and nutmeg, mixed and heated. Bumbo was popular in the Caribbean during the era of piracy, largely because it tasted better than Royal Navy grog. Pirates and short-haul merchantmen did not suffer from scurvy as often as British sailors, largely because their voyages were shorter and their diet included plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables. This meant that citrus juice could be dropped from the grog recipe, and sugar and nutmeg sweetened the mix. Bumbo was commonly used during election campaigns in colonial British America, to the extent that treating voters to gifts and other freebies during election campaigns was referred to as \"swilling the planters with bumbo.\" George Washington was particularly noted for using this technique. His papers state that he used 160 gallons of rum to treat 391 voters to bumbo during campaigning for the Virginia House of Burgesses in July 1758."@en ;

Below is a typical procedure for producing one variation of the Backdraft drink. The combination of warm alcohol, followed by inhaling vaporized alcohol, and then finishing with a highly spiced warm alcohol, makes the drinking of this drink difficult, and while it tends not to have an immediate effect (since it is drunk quickly), the warmth of the alcohol and the vapor, make the concentration and absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream quicker than other drinks, and produces a more profound impact. The procedure listed below is a typical illustration of how the drink is presented, and the steps used to produce the backdraft effect.

An Old Etonian is a gin cocktail which enjoyed great popularity in London, circa 1925. The cocktail takes its name from Eton College and from the college's alumni, who are often referred to as Old Etonians. The Garden Hotel in London is an example of an establishment that had mastered the Old Etonian cocktail during that era."@en ;

It is similar to a Negroni, but with Rye whiskey instead of Gin and the use of dry vermouth instead of sweet vermouth. This cocktail first appeared in Harry MacElhone's 1922 book, ABC of Mixing Cocktails. In the book he says the drink was invented by Sparrow Robertson, the Sporting editor of the New York Herald, in Paris. The drink possibly fell out of MacElhone's repertoire by 1927, when he published his next book, Barflies and Cocktails. In this book he swapped the Rye for Bourbon whiskey, and renamed the drink the \"Boulevardier\". Although possibly being abandoned by MacElhone, the recipe was published again in Harry Craddock's 1930 cocktail book, The Savoy Cocktail Book."@en ;

The Rose Bennie itself is known by several other names including \"The Bennie\" \"Rose Elsener\" and \"B Wright Elsener\" in some parts of the larger Washington, DC Area. Its origins are unknown, but it has gained significant notoriety since the mid-80s when it is believed to have been originally created by Dutch-Americans in Washington, DC. Enthusiasts say that the Rose Bennie is best enjoyed on a hot summer afternoon. While cranberry juice comprises the typical beverage, it has also been known to be made with many variations of cranberry juice cocktails, such as white-cran grape and cran-blueberry. Some purists are known to only use freshly crushed and sugared cranberries in their Rose Bennies."@en ;

It has been documented in numerous cocktail manuals dating back to the 19th century. Chicago restaurant critic John Drury included it in his 1931 guide Dining in Chicago, noting that it had been served at the American Bar in Nice and the Embassy Club in London. Whether it originated in Chicago is unknown. Recipes call for brandy; orange-flavored liqueur, such as curacao or triple sec; and bitters, stirred or shaken with ice, which may or may not be strained out afterward. In many versions of the drink, it is topped off with champagne or white wine. Some versions call for sugaring the rim of the glass. It can be served on the rocks in a double old-fashioned glass or, especially in the champagne variation, straight up in a champagne coupe or flute or a cocktail glass."@en ;

	dbo:abstract	"The boulevardier cocktail is an alcoholic drink composed of bourbon, sweet vermouth, and campari. Its creation is ascribed to Erskine Gwynne, an American-born writer who founded a monthly magazine in Paris called Boulevardier, which appeared from 1927 to 1932. The boulevardier is similar to a Negroni, sharing two of its three ingredients. It is differentiated by its use of bourbon whiskey or rye whiskey as its principal component instead of gin. Paul Clark, writing for the food blog Serious Eats, says, \"This isn't a Negroni. It is, however, the Negroni's long-lost autumnal cousin.\" He continued: A simple substitution? Hardly. The bittersweet interplay between Campari and vermouth remains, but the whiskey changes the storyline. Where the Negroni is crisp and lean, the Boulevardier is rich and intriguing. There's a small difference in the preparation, but the result is absolutely stunning. Recipes vary the proportions of its components. Some boulevardier recipes call for 1 1/2 parts rather than 1 part whiskey, or call for two parts bourbon to one part vermouth and one part campari."@en ;
